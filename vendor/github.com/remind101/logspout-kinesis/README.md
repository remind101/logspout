# logspout-kinesis [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/remind101/logspout-kinesis.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/remind101/logspout-kinesis)

A [Logspout](https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout) adapter for writing Docker container logs to [Amazon Kinesis](http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/).

## usage
After you created your custom Logspout build (see below), you can just run it as:
```console
$ 	docker run --rm \
		-e LOGSPOUT=ignore \
		--name="logspout" \
		--volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
		mycompany/logspout kinesis://
```

You will need the Amazon credentials in the form of environment variables, or whatever suits you.
You will also neeed to set the environment variables `KINESIS_STREAM_TEMPLATE` and `KINESIS_PARTITION_KEY_TEMPLATE`, see below.

### streams and partition key configuration
You can decide to route your logs to one or multiple Kinesis Streams (and their names) via the the `KINESIS_STREAM_TEMPLATE` environment variable.  Golang's [text/template](http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) package is used for templating, where the model available for templating is the [Message struct](https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/blob/master/router/types.go).

For instance, you can decide to assign a Kinesis stream for each of you app (assuming you have a `app` label on your running containers:
```console
$ export KINESIS_STREAM_TEMPLATE={{ index .Container.Config.Labels "app" }}
```

Or you can use environment variables, with our provided lookUp template function:
```console
$ export KINESIS_STREAM_TEMPLATE={{ lookUp .Container.Config.Env "APP_ID" }}
```

This will search through `.Container.Config.Env` for `APP_ID=*` and return the value after the `=`.

**IMPORTANT**: if executing the stream name template results in an empty string, logspout-kinesis won't stream the log message. If debug logging is activated (see below), it will tell you so.

You can similarly decide the format of your partition key for each of your stream (here the app name and process type):
```console
$ export KINESIS_PARTITION_KEY_TEMPLATE={{ index .Container.Config.Labels "app" }}.{{ index .Container.Config.Labels "process.type" }}
```

**IMPORTANT**: if the partition key end up being an empty string, logspout-kinesis will default to set it as a uuid. If debug logging is activated (see below), it will tell you so.

### stream creation
By default, logspout-kinesis **will** create a stream if it is missing from Kinesis.

### stream tagging
By default, logspout-kinesis **will** tag a stream it just created.

You can set the `KINESIS_STREAM_TAG_KEY` environment variable to set the tag key, and the `KINESIS_STREAM_TAG_VALUE` variable to set the template you want to use for the tag value.

A complete example would be:
```console
KINESIS_STREAM_TAG_KEY="app"
KINESIS_STREAM_TAG_VALUE={{ lookUp .Container.Config.Env "EMPIRE_APPNAME" }}
```

### logging
To activate logging, set the `KINESIS_DEBUG` environment variable to `true`.

## build
**logspout-kinesis** is a custom logspout module. To use it, create an empty Dockerfile based on `gliderlabs/logspout:master`, and import this `logspout-kinesis` package into a new `modules.go` file. The `gliderlabs/logspout` base image will `ONBUILD COPY` and replace the original `modules.go`.

The following example creates a minimal logspout image capable of writing Dockers logs to Kinesis:

In modules.go:
```golang
package main

import (
	_ "github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/httpstream"
	_ "github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/routesapi"
	_ "github.com/remind101/logspout-kinesis"
)
```

In Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM gliderlabs/logspout:master
```

Final step, build the image:
```console
$ docker build -t mycompany/logspout .
```

More information on custom modules is available at the Logspout repo: [Custom Logspout Modules](https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout/blob/master/custom/README.md)
